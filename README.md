# recruiterbot
How to run?
1. Add your OpenAI key in "bot_files/NewQuestion.py"
2. Add resumes to the folder "files" or through the UI. (Note: Currently the embeddings are created and loaded on the existing database. If you want to recreate the embeddings, uncomment line 54-58 in NewQuestion.py and run it once to recreate the database.)
3. Run index.py and open localhost to see the UI.
